                                        Gynecomastia is a male breast reduction surgery. This procedure is designed for men who have developed excess breast tissue on one or both breasts, commonly due to fluctuations in hormones or from a weight gain. Patients with gynecomastia are not able to lose the excess breast tissue with weight-loss.

                                        In some circumstances, yes. This is a difficult procedure for insurance to approve. It is necessary to come in for a consultation and allow The Hair and Shape Clinic to evaluate you to see if he thinks you are a good candidate for this procedure. If you meet the requirements for insurance coverage, our office will apply for prior authorization, which can take 2-3 weeks or more.

                                        Most patients prefer to take 1 to 2 weeks off of work for their recovery. You will also have physical restrictions for at least 4 to 6 weeks following surgery. During this time, you cannot exercise, go to the gym, or engage in any strenuous activity. You will need to minimize your arm movements as well, to help optimize recovery (no lifting, pulling, or stretching).
