                                <p>Your face is the first thing that people see when you meet. Your face can make you feel beautiful, confident, successful, and it can leave a lasting impression on others. You rely on its appearance to aid in recognition, communication, and first impressions of your identity and personality.</p>
                                <p>If you have noticed the emergence of facial aging signs, such as jowls, flattened cheeks, and sagging skin, you might be interested in learning how a facelift with Dr.Umang Kothari can help to recapture a more youthful appearance from earlier years. Not only do our facelift patients typically see a fresher face post-surgery, but they also often regain a great deal of self-confidence.</p>

                    <h2>Facelift Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Also known as a rhytidectomy, the process of the facelift procedure depends largely on your individual features and goals. In general, the incision for a facelift begins within the hairline above each ear and continues around and behind the ear. These incisions are placed in such a way that they are typically well concealed by your hairline.</p>
                    <p>During the procedure, Dr.Umang Kothari will tighten the loosened facial muscles and the other underlying soft tissues to help create a youthful architecture beneath the facial skin. The skin can then be made smooth over these recontoured deeper tissues, typically providing a long-lasting, more youthful appearance. Dr.Umang Kothari multi-layer approach to facelifting provides results that are generally superior to traditional skin tightening methods and often have longer lasting results.</p>
                    <p>The total procedure time and costs can vary. Often, the facelift operation is combined with other facial procedures, such as brow lift, facial fat-grafting, eyelid surgery, and rhinoplasty. During your initial consultation, together with Dr.Umang Kothari, you will be able to determine the procedure combination that is most likely to achieve your surgical goals.</p>

                    <h2>Recovery from Your Facelift Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Within a few hours following your facelift procedure, you will either be released to begin your recovery at home, or you will be given the option to stay overnight at the surgery center. Dr.Umang Kothari will give you his recommendation and allow you to make this decision based on available at-home care and the extent of your procedure.</p>
                    <p>After your facelift you will likely experience a moderate amount of swelling and bruising. These effects will subside in approximately two to three weeks. The best way to speed the healing process after a facelift is to follow Dr.Umang Kothari post-operative instructions, which will be provided to you prior to your surgery. You will be advised to refrain from any physical activity for about 4-6 weeks after surgery. Most patients return to their jobs within 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. Dr.Umang Kothari will help you plan the amount of time off that is appropriate for your recovery.

                                            Absolutely! Facelifts are often combined with blepharopasty (eyelid surgery), brow lift surgery, facial-fat grafting, rhinoplasty, or chin implant surgery. In some situations, patients may even choose to have certain body procedures done at the same time to optimize their recovery period. Dr.Umang Kothari will evaluate your specific concerns during your initial consultation to see if you would be an appropriate candidate for these additional procedures.

                                            Many patients look and feel like “themselves” about 2 weeks after surgery. If you are comfortable enough, you may be able to return to work after 2 weeks, but you will still have physical restrictions for approximately 4-6 weeks after surgery.

                                            As with most other surgical procedures, the results of a facelift typically will last for many years but will not be permanent. After the reset in time provided by a facelift, natural aging resumes. It is important to take good care of yourself in the years following your facelift to maximize the number of years you will see these positive results. You should use good skincare products and daily sun protection, eat healthy, and take care of yourself physically. In addition to making you feel good, these things will lengthen the life of your facelift.
