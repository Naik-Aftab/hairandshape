                    <h2>How long does a thread lift last?</h2>
                    <p>Results from a thread lift are temporary, lasting from one to three years. Over time, the threads dissolve, and your body absorbs them. If you like your results, you can have another thread lift procedure.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Who&apos;s a good candidate for a thread lift?</h2>
                    <p>A thread lift is generally best for people who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are experiencing early signs of aging.</li>
                        <li>Are in their late 30s to early 50s.</li>
                        <li>Don&apos;t expect dramatic results.</li>
                        <li>Don&apos;t want to have cosmetic surgery.</li>
                        <li>Had a facelift (rhytidectomy) or neck lift and want to refresh their results.</li>                
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What types of thread lifts are available?</h2>

                        <li><b>Cat or fox eye thread lift:</b> This involves lifting the eyebrows toward the temples to give your eyes a catlike look.</li>

                        <li><b>Nose thread lift:</b> A plastic surgeon injects threads to lift, straighten or slim your nose. In some cases, they may combine a nose thread lift with dermal fillers.</li>
