                    <h2>How is the Lip reduction surgery done?</h2>
                    <p>Lip Reduction surgery entails removing the mucosa & submucosa tissues on either one or both upper and lower lips as per your requirement. On-consultation, you can discuss your requirements in detail with your surgeon. The surgery is done under local anesthesia. Then, an incision is made on the inner portion of your lip to minimize the scarring effect post-recovery. The tissues are removed meticulously and the incision is stitched with absorbable stitches which falls within 2-3 weeks.</p>
