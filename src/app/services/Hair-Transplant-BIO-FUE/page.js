                                <p>The Hair And Shape Clinic is a state-of-the-art hair restoration centre. Our experts utilize the most advanced hair transplant techniques available today</p>
                                <p>FUE is a minimally invasive hair restoration surgery that uses advanced technology to track and extract hair follicles with precise accuracy and control. The process involves using a small (0.8mm - 1.0mm), rounded instrument or “punch” to make a small, round incision in the skin around a follicular unit, isolating it from the surrounding tissue. The unit is then extracted (pulled) directly from the scalp, leaving a small open hole.</p>
                                <p>There are 3 variations of FUE Hair Transplant :</p>

                    <h2>5 Steps of Hair Transplant Process</h2>
                    <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'none' }}>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Step 1 - CONSULTATION :</strong> Operation Plan & Hairline Design.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Step 2 - PREPARATION :</strong> Haircut & Local Anaesthesia : Preparing the Donor Area
                            First, we identify the recipient areas and work to personalize a plan to help you achieve the most natural-looking hairline possible.
                            Next, we trim the hair in your donor area to facilitate the identification and removal of strong, healthy donor hairs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Step 3 - EXTRACTION :</strong> Extracting hair follicles from donor areas : Removing and Preparing the Hair Follicles
                            <ul>
                                <li>Once the donor area is prepared, we remove individual follicular units from your scalp by making a tiny circular incision around them to isolate the graft. Then we extract the graft from the scalp using a forcep-like instrument.</li>
                                <li>Our trained technicians examine the follicular grafts and prepare them for placement.</li>
                                <li>Follicular unit grafts are arranged into groups depending on the number of hairs in each follicle (1-4 hairs are commonly found within each follicular unit).</li>
                                <li>Based on your specific hair loss pattern, we map out the optimal placement of each follicular unit group in order to achieve the most natural-looking results.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Step 4 - INCISION :</strong> Opening channels for transplantation : Placing the Follicular Units
                            <ul>
                                <li>When the follicular grafts are ready, we make small incisions in your recipient area that match your natural hair growth pattern.</li>
                                <li><strong>BIO FUE-</strong>  18 G Hypodermic Needle is used to make the slits (1.2mm diameter)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Step 5 -  Implantation :</strong> Implanting hair follicles to affected area :
                            <ul>
                                <li>The follicular grafts are then strategically placed one by one, according to the number of hairs within each follicle, in order to maximize the naturalness, density and coverage of the thinning areas.</li>
                                <li><strong>BIO FUE & SAPPHIRE FUE </strong>  - Double forceps technique is used to implant the grafts</li>
                                <li><strong>BIO FUE -</strong> A specialized device called <strong>KEEP’S IMPLANTER</strong> is used for implantation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Body Hair Transplant</h2>
                    <p>BHT for treating male pattern hair loss is a refined technique, for the body hairs, can be challenging at times to extract.</p>
                    <p>Since FUE leaves behind no linear scars it is more suitable to harvest from various body areas including beard, chest & pubic regions. Body Hair Transplant (BHT) is the harvesting of hair from a location where it is not wanted and subsequently transplanted to the scalp. The donor area in BHT is often the chest .The harvest of the donor is through the use of the Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) procedure. The characteristics of hair in these locations are different than scalp hair. The hair in the chest tends to be curlier and thinner than scalp hair. The growth phase or anagen phase last less than that of scalp hair, usually about 18 months. The hair characteristics of this chest hair render the hair suitable only as filler hair in the middle of the scalp. BHT is not suitable for hairline or crown because of the hair characteristics and shorter growth phase. BHT should only be used when donor is in limited supply, because hair from the permanent donor zone is best for hair restoration.</p>

                    <h2>BENEFITS OF A FUE HAIR TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No stitches; donor area appears mostly unchanged within days</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Natural-looking results</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>State-of-the-art minimally invasive technique</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Simple outpatient procedure</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Fast recovery; many patients return to work the next day</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>How to take care after Hair Transplant | Things to do post surgery |</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The patient goes home after the procedure with the instructions and everything necessary for the post-operative care at home: an antibiotic, painkiller, anti-inflammatory & anti-itching tablet is taken for 5 days , the implanted area is moisturized with a saline spray for 7 days (every 30 minutes to 1 hour) and sterile pillow covers must be used.</li>
                        <li>The hair that is transplanted in the graft normally falls out within the 3-4 weeks of the procedure.</li>
                        <li>The new hair will then grow from the hair root and will be noticeable by approximately 5 months and carry on growing. A post operative check up is carried out after 6 months and an assessment of the final outcome of surgery is normally made after 12 months when the grafts are fully grown.</li>
                        <li>The recovery is very short, usually, within 5-7 days all signs of hair transplant will disappear. The success is not only the natural hair growth but the subsequent natural-looking results. The check-up, if necessary, is within a month.</li>
                    </ul>

                                            Gynecomastia is a male breast reduction surgery. This procedure is designed for men who have developed excess breast tissue on one or both breasts, commonly due to fluctuations in hormones or from a weight gain. Patients with gynecomastia are not able to lose the excess breast tissue with weight-loss.

                                            Most patients prefer to take 1 to 2 weeks off of work for their recovery. You will also have physical restrictions for at least 4 to 6 weeks following surgery. During this time, you cannot exercise, go to the gym, or engage in any strenuous activity. You will need to minimize your arm movements as well, to help optimize recovery (no lifting, pulling, or stretching).
