                                <h2>Rhinoplasty</h2>
                                <p>There are no set standards for the definition of a beautiful nose. Face shape and contour, facial features, and personal opinion are all variables that help determine whether a nose is aesthetically pleasing. If you feel that a different nose would improve the appearance of your face, rhinoplasty may benefit you. The Hair and Shape Clinic specializes in cosmetic enhancement and functional improvement of the nose.</p>
                                <p>The Hair and Shape Clinic performs nose surgery (rhinoplasty) to help correct the following common concerns: hump on the nose, overly big or wide nose, large nose, short or long nose, droopy nose, hooked or crooked nose, flaring nostrils, ethnic nose, deviated septum, and revision nose surgery. The Hair and Shape Clinic goal with rhinoplasty is to help create a flattering nose shape in proportion to the rest of your face. The information below will provide further details about the rhinoplasty procedure and setting up a consultation at our clinic in Malad West Mumbai</p>

                    <h2>Rhinoplasty Consultation</h2>
                    <p>If you are dissatisfied with the cosmetic appearance of your nose and are seeking rhinoplasty nose reshaping, you may have spent a significant amount of time determining what you do and do not like about your nose. The consultation provides The Hair and Shape Clinic a chance to hear your concerns and at the same time examine your nose. He will then discuss with you a surgical plan for improving the shape and function of your nose. In addition, he will discuss other factors that may influence the outcome of your surgery, such as the structure of your nasal bones and cartilages, the shape of your face, and the thickness of your skin. It is important that you share your complete medical history with The Hair and Shape Clinic during the consultation. This includes your general health, any medications you take, history of allergies and breathing difficulties, previous nasal surgery, and any prior injuries to your nose. During your consultation, you will have the opportunity to ask any questions or address any specific concerns that you may have. You will have an additional chance to review any information you like during your preoperative visit to our office in Walnut Creek.</p>
                    <p>During your consultation, our Patient Care Coordinator will provide you with information regarding surgery scheduling and costs, with a detailed breakdown of the surgical and anesthesia fees. Insurance policies do not cover cosmetic nose surgery. However, if part of the procedure is performed to correct breathing problems, then that portion of the procedure alone may be covered by your insurance. If you are coming from areas outside of San Francisco or California, our office can help you coordinate your preoperative visit with your surgery to decrease travel needs and make efficient use of the time you spend in the Walnut Creek and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

                    <h2>Preparing for Your Nose Reshaping Surgery</h2>
                    <p>In preparation for your surgery, you will be asked to avoid certain medications, minimize intake of alcoholic beverages, stop smoking two weeks prior to your rhinoplasty surgery, and avoid taking certain supplements and vitamins. You should arrange for someone to drive you to and from the surgery center and to take care of you for a few days after the operation. Most patients need only limited help after a rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty. It is a good idea to prepare your house so that you will have a place to sleep with your head elevated for the first week after surgery. You can do this by sleeping with several pillows under your head and back or by sleeping in a recliner chair.</p>

                    <h2>The Rhinoplasty Surgery</h2>
                    <p>Your rhinoplasty surgery will be performed at our outpatient surgical facility in Walnut Creek. General anesthesia is used to help keep you asleep and comfortable for the surgery. This helps to maximize comfort for you during the surgery and maintains safety of your airway. Minor nose procedures may be performed under sedation.</p>
                    <p>During your rhinoplasty operation, the nose bones and cartilages are sculpted to the desired shape. The reshaping of your nose may require delicate repositioning of your nasal bones. The intricacies of rhinoplasty surgery, however, center more around the refinement of the nasal tip cartilages, proper reshaping of the middle portion of the nose, and delivering a balanced and natural-looking nose for your face.</p>
                    <p>The Hair and Shape Clinic performs both the “open” and “closed” rhinoplasty techniques. In “Open Rhinoplasty,” a small stair-step incision over the skin between your nostrils, called the columella, typically allows direct access to the cartilages and bones of the nose. The open technique is extremely precise and allows The Hair and Shape Clinic to directly visualize the structures which need to be reshaped. In the “Closed Rhinoplasty,” the incisions are placed inside the nose. This technique commonly has less swelling after the surgery and is often ideal for those who do not require significant reshaping of the cartilages of the nose. The Hair and Shape Clinic will discuss with you the appropriate procedure for your nose during your consultation. At the conclusion of your rhinoplasty surgery, a splint is applied to the outside of your nose to help maintain its new shape. Also, if any internal nose work was done, such as septoplasty, then internal nasal splints will also be applied.</p>

                    <h2>After Your Rhinoplasty Nose Surgery</h2>
                    <p>In most cases, you may go home the same day after your nose surgery. If you have come to the Walnut Creek from out-of-state or traveled a long distance, you should plan to stay locally for the first week following surgery. You typically will be seen in our office within 6 to 8 days after surgery. Pain medication will be prescribed for you to help keep you comfortable after nose surgery. There are two things for you to be vigilant about in the first week after surgery. The first is to keep your head elevated at all times for the first week after surgery. Use two or three pillows or sleep in a recliner with your head elevated. This will help reduce swelling and bruising and minimize risk of complications. The second is to make sure your nose splint stays on by keeping it dry. Avoid hot, steamy baths or showers as this will cause the nose splint to loosen. You may apply an ice pack to your nose and lower forehead for the first 24 to 36 hours after surgery.</p>
                    <p>After rhinoplasty surgery, particularly during the first 48 hours, plan on staying in bed with your head elevated. The swelling and bruising around your eyes will increase at first, typically reaching a peak after two or three days. Following the first three days, you most likely will begin to feel better quickly. Most of the swelling and bruising commonly disappears within the first 7 to 10 days after surgery. Avoid blowing your nose for the first 4 weeks after your surgery while the tissues heal. The nasal splints will be removed around 7-8 days after the surgery. Sutures used during Rhinoplasty nose surgery are generally self-dissolving and do not need to be removed.</p>
                    <p>In the days following surgery, when your face may be bruised and swollen, it is easy to forget that this swelling and bruising will quickly subside to reveal a beautiful nose. In fact, many patients feel depressed for a short while after plastic surgery. This is quite normal and understandable. This may be exacerbated by disrupted sleeping patterns and use of pain medication in the first few days following surgery. This stage will pass quickly. Day by day, your nose will begin to look better and your spirits will improve. Within 10 days to 2 weeks you will no longer look as if you have just had surgery. While most swelling will resolve quickly, a small amount of swelling in the tip area could potentially take longer to resolve. This portion of the swelling will usually resolve by a year after surgery and therefore, the final result of your rhinoplasty will be visible approximately a year after surgery. That being said, your nose will most likely look quite normal to others within weeks of surgery and most patients and their friends are not aware that there is still swelling that needs to resolve.</p>

                                Absolutely! A rhinoplasty can be combined with almost any other procedure. Certain procedures can complement the results of rhinoplasty. For example, a chin implant or genioplasty can enhance the results of your procedure. Some patients prefer to have other unrelated procedures done at the same time to optimize their healing and recovery time.</div>

                                In some situations, insurance might cover a portion of a septoplasty which is the internal portion of a “septorhinoplasty”. This is the procedure that corrects a deviated septum and alleviates certain breathing issues. Rhinoplasty is almost never covered by insurance, as it is considered elective. In the event that a septoplasty is covered by your insurance, it typically will also cover a portion of the surgery center and anesthesia fees for your procedure.

                                The ideal age for female patients is at least 16 years of age and older, and for male patients, 18 years of age and older. Before those ages, the nose and mid-face are still undergoing progressive growth. Surgery performed much earlier could result in less predictability of the final outcome. If you have not yet reached the appropriate age, Dr Umang Kothari can always see you and your guardian for a consultation to determine if you are a good candidate or if you should wait a few more years.
