                                <p>Women who have breasts which are proportionately too large for their bodies may face medical problems as well as aesthetic concerns. The Hair and Shape Clinic can help to relieve some of these issues by performing breast reduction, also known as reduction mammaplasty. This surgery is designed to decrease the size of the breasts and make them more proportional to the rest of the body.</p>

                    <h2>Who Is a Good Candidate for Breast Reduction?</h2>
                    <p>As with any other plastic surgery procedure, such as breast augmentation, breast reduction requires careful consideration of your medical and aesthetic goals before surgery.</p>
                    <p>In general, if you experience any of the following symptoms, you may benefit from breast reduction surgery:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Persistent back or neck pain</li>
                        <li>Frequent headaches</li>
                        <li>Indentations in your shoulders caused by bra straps</li>
                        <li>Redness and chafing caused by tight bra straps</li>
                        <li>Reluctance to participate in athletics due to discomfort or embarrassment</li>
                        <li>Difficulty finding clothes that fit well</li>
                        <li>Trouble breathing at night or sleeping on your stomach</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>The Breast Reduction Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Since the goal of reduction mammaplasty is to remove excess skin and tissue, more incisions are needed than for other breast surgery, such as augmentation. Dr. Umang Kothari will create an incision that goes around the areola, down the lower front of the breast, and in cases of very large breasts, along the crease beneath the breast. After removing the desired amount of tissue, The Hair and Shape Clinic will tighten up and remove any excess skin, reposition the nipple to its new location, lift the breasts, and close the incisions.</p>
                    <p>As with any surgery, the scars from breast reduction will never go away completely; however, since they are located on the lower areas of the breasts you will be able to wear a variety of lingerie, swimsuits, or low-cut gowns typically with no scars showing at all.</p>
                    <h2>After the Breast Reduction Procedure</h2>
                    <p>Immediately after surgery, you will be asked to spend at least one to two weeks to recover in the comfort of your home. During this time, it is important that you rest and minimize your arm movements as much as possible. You will be given post-operative instructions prior to surgery, and it is crucial that you follow these instructions.</p>
                    <p>Most patients can return to normal, non-strenuous daily activities after one to two weeks. For more strenuous activities, such as exercise, it is important to wait at least 6 weeks or until given clearance by Dr. Umang Kothari</p>
                    <p>To schedule a consultation with Dr. Umang Kothari regarding breast reduction, please contact our office today. This procedure is an opportunity to relieve long standing pain and discomfort as well as pursue new activities and clothing styles.</p>
