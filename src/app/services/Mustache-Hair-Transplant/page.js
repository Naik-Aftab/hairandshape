                                <p>Having bold and thick moustaches represents a powerful symbol of masculinity and maturity in men. However, some men suffer a moustache hair loss or are genetically predisposed to absent or thin moustache hair.</p>
                                <p>Injuries, trauma to the face, and other causes resulting in scarring may lead to less hair growth or hair loss in the moustache area. Moustache hair loss causes not merely appearance issues for men but might also generate mental issues.</p>
                                <p>The moustache transplantation represents a lifetime solution for these problems. The procedure includes transferring the hair follicles from the donor area and their implantation into the moustache area. The surgery itself lasts a few hours, typically between 3 and 4 hours, depending on the number of grafts required for the desired results. The procedure itself is very similar to a standard hair transplant procedure, and is a subset of the beard transplant. It gives the best results in patients over 20 years of age.</p>

                    <h2>How is Mustache Transplant Procedure done?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Mustache hair transplant involves the procedure of extracting live hair grafts i.e. hair follicles from the donor sites of the patient&apos;s head and implanting in the defect area [scaror very thin region] or for creation of new mustache in congenitally absent persons.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mustache hair transplant procedure is done by the FUE technique of hair transplantation. This is used to enhance the growth of mustache hair.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In this the grafts are extracted from the donor area with FUE technique and implanted in the defect area of mustache. Sometimes total recreation of mustache is required with more number of grafts. Approximately 500-600 grafts are required for a thick beard creation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The grafts are extracted from donor area where the quality of hair is suitable to mustache hair quality.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Generally parietal and occipital area is suitable. Type of grafts is singles and doubles sometimes multies can also be preferred depending on the quality of hair. Implantation is done with stitch and place method so that dense packing can be achieved. Healing is scar less.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The entire procedure is done under local anesthesia in 3-4 hrs periods depending on number of grafts. No special post op rest or stay is needed. Mild swelling and redness will be cleared in 2-3 days.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                                        Gynecomastia is a male breast reduction surgery. This procedure is designed for men who have developed excess breast tissue on one or both breasts, commonly due to fluctuations in hormones or from a weight gain. Patients with gynecomastia are not able to lose the excess breast tissue with weight-loss.

                                        In some circumstances, yes. This is a difficult procedure for insurance to approve. It is necessary to come in for a consultation and allow The Hair and Shape Clinic to evaluate you to see if he thinks you are a good candidate for this procedure. If you meet the requirements for insurance coverage, our office will apply for prior authorization, which can take 2-3 weeks or more.

                                        Most patients prefer to take 1 to 2 weeks off of work for their recovery. You will also have physical restrictions for at least 4 to 6 weeks following surgery. During this time, you cannot exercise, go to the gym, or engage in any strenuous activity. You will need to minimize your arm movements as well, to help optimize recovery (no lifting, pulling, or stretching).
